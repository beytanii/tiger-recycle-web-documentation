                    <p>While we would like to do our research on recycling, we don’t know anything about what RIT has in terms of availability for recycling, and usage of different recycling methods on campus. We conducted various methods of gathering information. We sent out a survey and interviewed students to have a general recycling observations.</p>
                    <p>People like fast and efficient systems, automatic systems. Recycling bins are fast because you can just chuck your stuff in, we are familiar with placing items in a specific location.  We are efficient at putting things in a certain location, but when we have to make a decision, it drops in efficiency. Out of two choices, not just one now, how does one know where to put the bottle? Then the user has to make a choice and since this is a relatively new system, it’s not automatic decision making. Possible solutions (that are too specific for this time in the planning process but could improve mental efficiency: motivation through money deposits, increase bins with FMS.  We need to answer these questions with a preliminary user survey.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Are we looking at motivation or lack of for recycling
                        </li>
                        <li>Want to know if not recycling is due to a lack of understanding, lack of motivation, lack of convenience…</li>
                        <li>Maybe the problem lies not with a lack of something (not enough bins), but because there is too much of something (choices of where to put a recyclable object) and it is too confusing that way.</li>
                        <li>What is the posture of the users
                        </li>
                        <li>What features do we want to work with: how they think about the process, giving more information, defensive design, what the users do or what we do to the design.</li>
                        <li>Do a survey that bridges the gap between these features we want to change and the actual tasks associated with them by sending out a survey about users and how they interact with above  features.  Aka to understand the user posture (and also trash can posture, which is why we talk to FMS) and why it is not conducive to our goal aka more recycling.</li>
