                        <p><b>Ehren:</b><br>Feedback should be “more immediate”, report button on the machine. Seemed to be confused about why there was an interface directly on the bins, some wanted something along the lines of a map, or phone contact for FMS.</p>
                        <p><b>Bethany:</b><br>Having to scan/tap to get incentive is too much work; Have a separate report button on the machine instead of being a part of the system; Preference of having tiger bucks than just spending at digital den; Some of the process is redundant                        </p>
                        <p><b>Emma:</b><br>Recycling is too far, if it looks too complicated trash is the default, Redeem should be on the bottom, confused about the store.</p>
                        <p><b>Henry:</b><br>Adding a machine number to the machines, as “enter code” doesn’t show much as our lo-fi doesn’t replicate those needs, additionally, they felt the app seemed fine, other than wanting tiger bucks or being able to redeem things other than merch (option to transfer items to either cash or tiger pay). They also didn’t like the machine screen, they’d rather have a flat image of either a map of nearby locations, report button, and a machine number to identify. Additionally, they also added that when the contactless tap doesn’t work, the scan option and enter code option are nice to have but they won’t use it since it is a lot more work.</p>

                        <p><b>Ehren:</b><br>Testers seemed to navigate fine, Money seemed to be a big motivator, in addition to making it more necessary. Though the popular answer is that recycling is not necessary to one’s personal life.</p>
                        <p><b>Bethany:</b><br>Most of the testers could get around the app after telling them that it’s an incentive program app. They think that having a physical reward after recycling gives them motivation to recycle in a proper way. Most of the testers find the whole system interesting and they think it will encourage more people to recycle.</p>
                        <p><b>Emma:</b><br>Money is a main motivator, though there was a few hold-ups in the design. Most notably, we need a “bigger scan button, smaller redeem button” and some confusion about where the home button goes to. Recycling does not seem necessary, regardless of context to personal life.</p>
                        <p><b>Henry:</b><br>	All the testers could get around the app fine even with the first phase of testing. The answer to whether or not it was necessary was mixed. All testers stated that it would be necessary on a community level but not on a personal level. Regarding making it more necessary, most people said to implement a certain punishment for not recycling, similar to nyc’s  fine for littering. The same could be implemented for recycling in their opinions. Others said they didn’t know. To make it more motivating, they all said our system would suffice as there was some material reward that benefits them in the short term.
