                    <p>We are trying to tackle complex recycling problems on the RIT campus. The goal is to increase the number of recycled materials by visitors, students, faculty, and staff on the RIT campus. The current system is inadequate and inconvenient, leading to fewer people recycling their containers and throwing garbage into the nearest trash bin. Several problems arise from this scarcity: how do you increase motivation in proper recycling? Most people don't properly dispose of their waste because they think it's not beneficial. Without an incentive, there is a drastic decrease in the total amount of items placed in the proper bin.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>We plan to create a box-shaped trash kiosk. It detects and differentiates items based on their materials. It's linked to an app that will track the number of times you have recycled, along with a rewards program for people who participate in recycling on campus. The rewards program will give you points every time you recycle. Collected points can be redeemed at Digital Den or Dining. Our app will also include an infographic section to educate on good recycling practices, locations of other recycling bins that give monetary rewards, and in-depth information about recycling for those interested.
